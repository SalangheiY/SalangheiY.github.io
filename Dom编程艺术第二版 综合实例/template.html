				A few days before, a girl who studied abroad had the great
				 honor to speech at the graduation ceremony. When people 
				 from her country was looking forward to hearing her wonderful
				 speech, they were shocked by her exaggerate words. She said the 
				 air in her country was so bad that she needed to wear face mask 
				 every time she went out of the house. But when she stepped in 
				 America, she felt the sweet and fresh air. The fact is that the
				  quality of air in her hometown was good, and there was no need
				   to wear face mask. A lot of people criticized her for twisting 
				   the fact. They show their love to their own country. I love my 
				   country, because of its profound culture and diversity. Chinese 
				   food is famous around the world. I think my stomach can't get used 
				   to other country's food. I love everything of my country.
